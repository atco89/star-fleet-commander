Star Fleet Commander

You are a Star Fleet Commander. Assemble a fleet containing both military and 
civilian space ships. Every space ship type has a strength. Every space ship has
a call sign consisting of its class name and unique number within the fleet. Due
to war casualties you have to leave some space ships in the hands of 
inexperienced captains. Call sign of those ships will be followed with word 
"Junior".

You can order a fleet to take formations:

* In the Attack formation ships are organized in waves from stronger to weaker 
ships with civilian ships in the end.

* In the Escort formation military ships are organized in front and rear weave 
of mixed strength, with civilian ships in the middle.
Each weave is represented in a separate line.

Your fleet should consist of three military ships (Interceptor, Dreadnought, 
Leviathan) and two civilian ships (Transport, Recreation) at least.

Example output for the Attack formation:

Dreadnought 3, Dreadnought 6 Junior
Interceptor 1 Junior, Leviathan 5
Transport 2, Transport 8 Junior, Transport 9
Recreation 4, Recreation 7

Example output for the Escort formation:

Dreadnought 1, Dreadnought 4 Junior, Interceptor 8
Transport 3, Recreation 5, Transport 7 Junior
Interceptor 2 Junior, Leviathan 6
